# holoflow
Bioinformatics pipeline for hologenomics data generation and analysis

Snakemake is a workflow management system which requires from a *Snakefile* and a *config* file. This is a Bioinformatics pipeline implemented with Snakemake.

## Files and directories
### Main directory

The main *holoflow* directory contains a given number of Python scripts which work as launchers for the different **workflow programs** in the pipeline:

  - ***preparegenomes.py***   - Merge all potential reference genomes to sample into a single *.fna* file to be used in preprocessing.py.  
  - ***preprocessing.py***    - Data preprocessing from quality to duplicate sequences for further downstream analysis.
  - ***metagenomics_IB.py***  - Individual assembly-based analysis and metagenomics binning. 
  - ***metagenomics_CB.py***  - Coassembly-based analysis and metagenomics binning. 
  - ***metagenomics_AB.py***  - Functional annotation of (co-)assembly file with DRAM.  
  - ***metagenomics_DR.py***  - Dereplication and Annotation of metagenomic bins produced by either *metagenomics_IB* or *metagenomics_CB*. 
  - ***metagenomics_FS.py***  - Final statistical report of dereplicated bins obtained with *metagenomics_DR.py*. 
  - ***metagenomics_DI.py***  - Diet analysis from reads not mapped to MAG catalogue obtained in *metagenomics_FS.py*.  ######### NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL YET 
  - ***genomics.py***         - Variant calling, Phasing (for HD) and Imputation (for LD) with *genomics.py*. 

  
  
These are designed to be called from the command line and require the following arguments:  
```bash

```  
 
 
### Config files description
A template *config.yaml* file can be found in every workflow directory. 

### Input files description
A template *input.txt* file can be found in every workflow directory.  
See *input.txt* file description for every workflow:
In all cases, columns must be delimited by a simple space and **no blank lines should be found in the end of the file**.  
Those lines starting by # won't be considered.  
  
##### *preparegenomes.py*

  1. Reference genomes ID. **No spaces or undersquares** between different words in identifier.  
  2. Reference genome full path/name.   
  3. Desired output data base with all genomes name. **No spaces**, undersquares or other separators allowed. *All those reference genomes which should be in the same DB should have the same ID in this field*.  
  
  **The fields 1 and 3 must be different**
  
- Example:  

*Heads-up*: you can generate more than one DB at a time for different projects, be aware that preprocessing only takes ONE DB at a time with all reference genomes to be mapped to a set of samples in a given project.

| Genomeone   | /home/Genomeone.fq      | DBone  |
| Genometwo   | /home/Genometwo.fq.gz   | DBtwo  |

  2. Original full path/name of **FORWARD** input file. This can be both *.gz* or not compressed.  
  3. Original full path/name of **REVERSE** input file. This can be both *.gz* or not compressed.  
  
- Example:

|   |   |   |   |

Optimally the metagenomic .fastq files would come from PPR_03-MappedToReference, the last preprocessing step.

##### *genomics.py*

  1. Sample group name to analyse.  
  2. Path to directory containing host reads BAM alignment sorted files - If *preprocessing.py* was used, these are the resulting *ref* BAMs path.   
  3. Chromosome list. This should be a text file with a single column depicting chromosome IDs. Note that **the given chromosome IDs should be in accordance with the provided reference genome**, otherwise these won't be detected by Holoflow. Relevantly, if the used **reference genome does not have chromosomes**, the user can choose to analyse her dataset as one single chromosome, by only writing **ALL** in the chromosome list.

## Usage in Computerome

### Get started: download Holoflow repository
Clone the repository by running the following command on your command line:

```bash
git clone -b nurher --single-branch https://github.com/anttonalberdi/holoflow.git
```

### Execute Holoflow *.py* workflow launchers
These should be **executed as jobs**, therefore a *.sh* script should be generated which will call the desired Holoflow workflow:

- *.sh* example script for *preprocessing.py* called ***first_job_preprocessing.sh***:
```bash
#Declare full path to the project directory (the .sh file will be stored here as well)
projectpath=/full/path/project1
#Declare full path to holoflow
holoflowpath=/full/path/holoflow
#Run holoflow
python ${holoflowpath}/preprocessing.py -f ${projectpath}/input.txt -d ${projectpath}/workdir -g ${projectpath}/reference_genomes.fna -adapter1 'ATGCT' -adapter2 'CTTGATG' -c ${projectpath}/config.yaml -l ${projectpath}/log_file.log -t 40 -N First_job
```

- *job execution* in Computerome2 example:
```bash
 qsub -V -A ku-cbd -W group_list=ku-cbd -d `pwd` -e ${projectpath}/job_error_file.err -o ${projectpath}/job_out_file.out -l nodes=1:ppn=40,mem=180gb,walltime=5:00:00:00 -N JOB_ID ${projectpath}/first_job_preprocessing.sh

```
  Note that the job parameters: *ppn*, *nodes*, *memory*, *wall time* ... can and ought to be customised optimally for every job type.
